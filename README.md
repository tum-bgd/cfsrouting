====================

# Cellular Free Space Routing Package

This python package intends to provide certain functionalitites for constrained free space routing in a simple, clean and efficient implementation.

- [Alternative Path Examples with Simplification](docs/simplification.md)

# Build
Building is easy:

```
sudo make
```

... but you need to have Python, pip, and boost headers installed.

# Play with it
After building and installing (at least a develop version), you can spill up a jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
and start playing around.

# Example (see Simplification.ipynb)
